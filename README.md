# jacobs-alumni-style
Style Elements for Jacobs Alumni Portal and Website

This is intended to be used with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) like:

```javascript
require("jacobs-alumni-style");
```

In [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) it can instead be used like:

```javascript
import "jacobs-alumni-style/src/style.mjs";
import "jacobs-alumni-style/src/style.scss";
```

This will add both required JavaScript and CSS to the page.
